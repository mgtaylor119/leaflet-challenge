Using the USGS GeoJSON Feed, I selected ["All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), and built a map to show the visualization. Using Leaflet, I plotted all the earthquakes from the dataset using their longitude and latitude. Then I created markers to change in color based on the depth of the earthquake, and change in size based on the magnitude.

I created pop-ups to show the Magnitude, Location, and Depth of the corresponding earthquake.

Lastly, I created a legend to outline the different colors and the depths that correspond to them.
